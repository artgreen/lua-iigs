Port of LUA to the Apple IIgs

This project aims to port the Lua programming language to the Apple IIgs platform. 

The goals of this project:
- Bring Lua scripting to the IIgs platform
    - Lua interpreter to run arbitrary Lua scripts from the command line
    - Lua REPL for testing and exploration
    - Lua library to embed Lua into arbitrary programs
    - Luac compiler to generate bytecode
    - Give back to the Apple community by bringing a powerful tool to the Apple IIgs
